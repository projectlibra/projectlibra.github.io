## Welcome to LIBRA's Official Website

The aim of LIBRA is to provide a user-friendly genetic filtering and annotation system
equipped with a genetic profile matching platform, that can be quickly integrated and
easily used by medical institutions in order to explore genetic variation, detect and
diagnose rare diseases, as well as safely collect and store their data.

LIBRA is going to be a web application composed of two main modules: Genetic Variation
Query Interface and Patient Matching Platform. The first module provides an interface
for storing and annotating genomic data in order to query variants and explore the data,
whereas the second one acts as a patient social network for doctors who seek similar
genetic profiles related to a specific disease in order to understand and diagnose
the disease further. These modules will be integrated into the same user interface.
The potential users of this project are medical doctors in medium-sized hospitals,
laboratories and research centers in Turkey.
